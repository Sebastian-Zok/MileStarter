                            We want to raise 3 ETH in order to make SNORXEL successful. If we managed to raise the requried ETH we will get 50% transfered to our wallet.

                            After the fundraise we continue to provide you with updates on our development and start to deliver first protoypes to customers. If you are unhappy you have one year to use your DAO-Token to vote for a veto. If 50% of the pledgers decide to veto, you will get 0.5 ETH refunded and will not receive anything. You may also endanger that others who have not decided to veto, to get their SNORXEL. So decide wisely!
